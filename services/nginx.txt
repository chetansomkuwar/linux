How to Install Nginx on CentOS 7
Generally, CentOS is the preferred distribution package in the hosting industry. Currently, CentOS 8 is the latest version, while CentOS 7 is supported until the year 2024.
The configuration procedure below details the steps necessary to set up Nginx on CentOS 7.
For installation instructions for CentOS 8, please read How to Install Nginx on CentOS 8.


Step 1: Update Repository Package Lists
        yum update -y

Step 2:  Install Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)
        Nginx is not available in the standard repositories that come with the CentOS package,
		so you will need to install the EPEL repository on your server. EPEL is free to use and provides numerous open-source packages to install with Yum.


       To install EPEL, run the following command using the Yum package manager:
        
		sudo yum install -y epel-release -y
		
		
Step 3: Install Nginx
        Step number two has added the Nginx repository to your server. 
        Now, you can install Nginx by running the following yum command:

        sudo yum –y install nginx	


Step 4: Start Nginx Service
        Your instance of Nginx is installed, but it won’t start automatically.
   
        To start Nginx, run:

        sudo systemctl start nginx
        After you hit enter, you will not get a return value.
		However, Nginx should have started. To check its status, run:

        sudo systemctl status nginx


Step 5: Configure Nginx to Start on Boot
        Most admins will want to make sure that NGINX starts up automatically whenver the server restarts. 
		  To set this up, run:

         sudo systemctl enable nginx		
		 
		 
Step 6: Configure Firewall to Allow Traffic
        CentOS 7 enables firewalls by default and blocks access to ports 80 and 443. 
		It will block any inbound HTTPS and HTTP packets from Nginx.

    To allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic, run the following commands:

      firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=http
      firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=https
     firewall-cmd --reload		 
	 
Step 7: Verify Nginx Install
       The easiest way to check whether Nginx is running properly is by visiting your server’s public IP address.
	   Just open your web browser and visit http://server_IP_or_domain_name/
       First, find your server’s public IP address.

      ip address
